However, batch gradient descent is time- and memory-consuming, in the sense that it has to go through all the training examples and average all the gradients for a *single* step, and it quickly becomes impractical if the dataset or the model becomes large.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is *not* to see all the examples for a single gradient step.  Instead, for each step, we compute and average the gradients for only a small subset (commonly called a *minibatch*) of examples.
